# Data Quest Projects

This is a collection of projects that were assigned as part of the online track to data science offered by [dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io)

Most of them are jupyter notebook files, usually there is a short description at the start of each.  Each one explores different data sets and data science/analysis techniques, libraries, and other stuff.

Enjoy :)
